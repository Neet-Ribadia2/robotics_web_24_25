            BEST is a national eight-week robotics competition in the United
            States, held each fall. It is designed to inspire middle school and
            high school students to explore engineering careers by building
            robots, solving real-world problems, and developing teamwork skills.

          <p>
            The BEST competition began in 1993 when Texas Instruments engineers
            Ted Mahler and Steve Marum, inspired by a video of MIT freshmen
            building a robot, created the initiative during an Engineering Day
            event in Sherman. engaging students in engineering, science, and
            technology.

                  Students can join the robotics team by attending club meetings
                  every day and selecting one of the three divisions: marketing,
                  programming, or construction. Members are expected to actively
                  participate in their chosen division, collaborate with
                  teammates, and contribute to projects. Regular attendance and
                  effective communication are important to ensure everyone can
                  work together towards our goals and make the most out of the
                  experience!

                  We participate in BEST Robotics competitions, where our focus
                  is on completing specific tasks rather than traditional
                  preparation methods. Throughout the season, members are
                  assigned various tasks related to their division—marketing,
                  programming, or construction—that contribute to our overall
                  project. This approach helps us stay organized and ensures
                  that everyone plays a vital role in our competition efforts.

                  tools for construction and introductory lessons on programming

                  We typically work on a variety of projects that are assigned
                  based on the annual theme for BEST Robotics. These themes are
                  designed to be relevant and applicable for schools, allowing
                  us to create projects that can be utilized in educational
                  settings. Since the themes are predetermined, our focus is on
                  effectively completing the assigned projects rather than
                  selecting them ourselves.
